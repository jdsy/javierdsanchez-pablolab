JDSY -> need to add functions for changing from voltage bias to current bias for K2700

using Special Measure with Helium System.  

1. Open He4_init.m
2. This m file will declare smdata and smscan and then load smdata_He4. 
	Next it will:
	-load smdata_He4 which stores the data for the rack and connecting to teh instruments
	-connect to the instruments
	-setup the K2700 for either voltage sourcing (for BG ramps) or current source for T measurements
	-load scan BG.mat, basic Back gate ramping with K2700.
	-run smgui


When smgui starts it should be setup and ready for running a BG sweep.
Click on the "Scan" tab.  
BGV is the backgate voltage set by the K2700.  Min is the starting value, Max is the end value.  Most useful thing to do here is set the # of Points and the step time.

under "Record" set the values you want to measure.  Typically LockinX for your voltage measurement and BGI for measuring Backgate leakage current.

Choose a datafile for your measurement and a presentation.. and then give it a go!



***For ramping BG manually (inbetween scans)
use smset, BUT MAKE SURE TO SET RAMP RATE OR ELSE IT WILL INSTANTLY GO TO VALUE!
smset('channelname',value,ramprate)

Ex: to ramp to zero:

smset('BGV',0,0)
